# Login Page
## Login page using HTML, Css and JavaScript 

#### This is a School project
The task was to create a login page using HTML and CSS. 
I made 3 different versions and added JavaScript to make it more interactive as I wanted to create a login page where the different pages slides in/out depending on what the user chooses. 

Features:

* Works great on desktop and smaller screens 
* Semantic Html
* Css
* JavaScript
